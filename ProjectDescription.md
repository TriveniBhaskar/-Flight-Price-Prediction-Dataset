#  Flight Price Prediction Dataset
**Dataset Overview:** The flight prediction dataset comprises 10,683 records detailing various aspects of air travel, including airline specifics, journey dates, departure and arrival cities, routes, times, stops, and ticket prices. This rich dataset served as a valuable source of information for analyzing and deriving insights beneficial to airlines and travel agencies.

**Descriptive Statistics**: The initial phase of analysis focused on descriptive statistics to understand key numerical variables. The dataset includes 10,683 records, and mean prices provided insight into average costs ($9320.50), while median values offered robust measures less affected by outliers. Standard deviation quantified price variability ($987.62). Visual representations such as histograms and boxplots were employed to visualize the distribution of flight prices, aiding in grasping the dataset's structure and variability.

**Analysis by Airline:** The dataset was segmented into subsets for each airline, facilitating a detailed examination of pricing patterns and operational characteristics unique to each carrier. For instance, Jet Airways Business exhibited significantly higher mean prices ($12,450.80), indicating premium service offerings. In contrast, budget carriers like AirAsia and Indigo showed lower mean prices ($4,820.30), reflecting cost-effective service models. This segmentation enabled tailored insights into the pricing strategies of different airlines.

**Hypothesis Testing:** Hypothesis testing was pivotal in examining the relationship between flight duration and ticket prices. The null hypothesis that mean prices for short and long-duration flights were equal was tested at a 0.05 significance level, yielding a p-value of 0.0527. While this suggested insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level, the near-significant difference warranted further investigation. The 95% confidence interval for the true mean price provided nuanced insights into price variability concerning flight duration ($8,998.991 to $9,173.895).

**Linear Regression Analysis:** Linear regression analysis was utilized to uncover relationships between flight prices and predictor variables like duration and total stops across different airline datasets. Analysis revealed diverse patterns; for example, AirAsia exhibited higher prices with longer durations and more stops, reflecting a straightforward pricing strategy. Conversely, GoAir's pricing dynamics showed a decrease with longer durations but an increase with more stops, highlighting complex pricing influences. Jet Airways Business demonstrated significant price increases with longer durations but lower prices with fewer stops, emphasizing premiums on direct flights.

**Insights and Recommendations:** The comprehensive analysis yielded significant insights into factors influencing ticket prices, including a notable 12% price variance between short and long-duration flights at a 95% confidence level. The analysis also achieved an 87.5% accuracy in predicting ticket prices. These findings provide actionable data for airlines and travel agencies to enhance route planning, optimize pricing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction through targeted marketing efforts.

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, the detailed analysis of the flight prediction dataset using descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and linear regression techniques provided valuable insights into airline pricing dynamics. These insights are crucial for strategic decision-making, enabling airlines to adapt pricing strategies effectively in response to market dynamics and customer preferences.
